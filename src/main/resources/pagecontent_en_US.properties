articles.summary.first=To read
articles.text.one=In our time, it has become a popular advertising sports nutrition. Another is called dietary supplements. Recently, they have become more affordable for consumers. In this article I want to explain what sports nutrition understandable language, without unnecessary clever words and scientific terms. So it was clear to those who in this poorly understood. Write about all the supplements does not make sense, but the most popular ones I describe. This protein, creatine, gainer, amino acids. Still, there are fat burners, but I will not be considered here. Since they do not work without a diet. And indeed they are used less frequently than the same protein, for example, about which I will write in more detail. I used to not really trust the additives, but later revised his attitude toward them, try them for yourself. Many people think that this is some kind of drugs, such as medicine. And whether it is harmful to health. But it is not so. Sports nutrition is an ordinary power, from which all the excess is removed. No chemistry is not there. And dangerous, too, nothing, except that if it is not quality or expired. About the dosage will not write anything, it depends on the person's weight. On a different weight and different dosage and on the packaging about the weight does not say anything. Just about the company manufacturers of writing does not make sense. It is a very controversial issue. Now, in order for the different types of power supply:
articles.header.protein=Protein
articles.text.two=Soy Protein. Now soy protein is not so often found in commercially available. Because whey protein and egg types, are more popular among consumers and producers. The soy protein fewer amino acids when compared to the milk for example. But here too not all unique, soy contains a lot of the right. Egg protein is the longest in the assimilation, digest about 7-8 hours. On the one hand it is bad, but on the other hand is useful to have a drink at night. Let them digest. Ideally used together with whey protein. Whey Protein. It most carved amino acids, especially BCAA. This protein is called serum, since it is made from whey, which is formed during the manufacture of cheese. He digested faster than other proteins are not more than 4 hours. On the packaging with the whey protein can be seen the inscription: isolate, concentrate, hydrolyzate. This way of handling this protein. Isolate - purified proteins are digested within approximately 30 minutes. Concentrate - the most simple treatment serum is absorbed by no more than two hours. Hydrolysates - proteins that are absorbed almost immediately, because it is already split into amino acids. The best whey protein purified by all types of cleaning. So if you have to buy, it is him. Protein is sold in powder form and is mixed with water or milk in a special bank called shaker. Ideally, drink throughout the day in small portions whey and egg on the night. But individually, the organisms are all different, you need to try. So it depends on the amount of money that a person can spend on the purchase of protein.
articles.figcaption.second=WHEY - is a pure whey protein with minimal fat.
articles.header.gainer=Gainer
articles.text.three=Gainer is a mixture of protein and carbohydrates. gainers difference in the ratio of protein to carbohydrates. Where approximately 50-80% carbohydrates. Since carbohydrates are a source of energy for our bodies, this supplement is very useful. Gainer need to pick up for themselves. If a person is predisposed to be overweight and have a slow metabolism, then it will suit gainer in which a high content of proteins. If on the contrary, metabolism faster, the choice falls on the gainer, which is dominated by carbohydrates. Gainer used immediately after training, which would replenish the lost energy costs. Is sold in powder form is mixed with water in the same shaker. Cost cheaper gainer protein. But they should not be abused. Especially those who easily gain weight.
articles.figcaption.third=Serious Mass - is a high gainer, which includes in the optimum proportions of proteins, micro / macro cells and carbohydrates, manufactured by Optimum Nutrition.
articles.header.aminoacids=Amino acids
articles.text.four=Amino acids - the building blocks for muscle. Protein is a protein which is cleaved to amino acids. Therefore, the amino acids are essential for a person who is swinging. Every day we use different amino acids with the usual food every day. But this is not enough for the body, which is subjected to intense physical stress. Besides amino acids, which are absorbed by the food immediately, but within 2-3 hours. After all, the food should be divided into perevaritsya.Aminokisloty: essential (you need to consume each day with food), conditionally-essential (can be formed from other acids in the body) and nonessential (also produced from other amino acids). Useful properties will not list that would not stretch the article. Essential - isoleucine, leucine, valine, histidine, lysine, methionine, fenilalanintreonin, tryptophan. Related replaceable - arginine, cysteine, tyrosine. Interchangeable - Alanya, aspartic acid, cystine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, ornithine, proline, serine, taurine. How to choose the desired amino acids? It is clear that the most useful and valuable is the essential amino acids. So, we go to the store and look up, which is written in the bank. The more there are the essential amino acids, the more effective is the amino acid complex. But the rest of the amino acids are also useful, so it is advisable to use a number of different amino acid complexes. There are amino acids such as BCAA, as there are only three amino acids, but all the essential (isoleucine, leucine, valine). Mainly used for drying, together with some further amino acids. For more information about the amino acids can be found in the textbook on organic chemistry. It is worth to say that amino acids are sold in different forms. The tablets, as a liquid, powder, capsules, chewable. Naturally those liquid absorbed faster. Eat immediately after exercise is necessary. I like tablets. With them less hassle. And it is easy to determine the dose. But you need to select them individually, as well as all other supplements. Price, firm structure - everything matters.

articles.header.creatine=Creatine
articles.text.five=Creatine is a supplement that helps uplift forces. The most effective of all additives. And that is the cheapest. It lasts for a long time, because the dosage is not large compared with the same protein or Gainer. Now there are many types of creatine. But the cheapest and most popular is creatine monohydrate. The difference between the rest of the creatine from it only in the fact that there is still a molecule of the sight of something else other than a water molecule. For example, creatine citrate molecule contains citric acid, creatine phosphate - phosphate molecule, etc. In fact, the only difference is the price. Creatine sell powders, chewable tablets, capsules, and liquid form. Best powder, the most convenient capsules. Chewing on the fan, walk and chew it not everyone will like it. And the one in liquid form has a small shelf life, buy a big risk of delay. Still need to know that creatine powder is mixed in water is bad and it must be abundantly drink. It is best to stir with juice, because it is so quickly absorbed. To do without sports nutrition, of course you can, but at the same time to replace all these substances are simple meal is quite problematic. For example what would the body received 30 grams of protein you need to eat 8 egg whites or drink a protein shake. Cocktail drink more easily and absorb it faster. But do not forget that the food supplements is not a substitute for conventional food. They are so called - "additive". The main mistake that may allow the person buying the supplements is to stop eating normal food, but eat only sport Pete.
articles.figcaption.six=Creatine Micronized - this is the most affordable form of creatine, which is used by athletes as an important supplement to the daily diet.
articles.average.header.second=Myths and facts
articles.text.six=Some fitness enthusiasts relate to sports nutrition rather skeptical. They can understand when some websites write about the terrible consequences of the use of sports nutrition, while others openly advertise his head starts to go around. The question arises: Does it really need is sports nutrition? Perhaps even better to do without him?
articles.header.small.first=Myth \u21161. Sports nutrition is suitable only athletes
articles.text.seven="This is not true. There are plenty of supplements for athletes and for people leading a healthy lifestyle, and for ordinary people. A classic example - Coenzyme Q10, drug, actively advertised as a means of extending the longevity. It is also included in the range of vitamin and mineral supplements for athletes. The only difference: "sports" Coenzyme Q10 contains a large dose of the active ingredient than the pharmacy. People who do not do sports, it makes sense to take it during an illness, during rehabilitation, and so on. Another example - the means to facilitate the development of testosterone. They are relevant for older people, because with age the production of the most important hormones slows down. Well sports chondroitin and glucosamine to help restore the injured joints. "
articles.header.small.second=Myth \u21162. Means for growing thin athletes do not fit
articles.text.eight="On the contrary, people who lose weight tend to limit themselves in power, and it is fraught with negative consequences for the whole organism. Such people can be advised of the vitamins and minerals as well as protein supplements. Protein - basic building blocks of our muscles, skin and internal organs, and protein deficiency will negatively affect the work of the whole organism. Additives, accelerating metabolism, are also needed. By reducing caloric intake slows down the metabolism, which in turn slows down the weight loss process. "
articles.header.small.third=Myth \u21163. Sports Nutrition - a solid chemistry
articles.text.nine="Not true. Most of the sports nutrition - a natural supplement. For example, protein powders produced from milk whey, soy, egg protein. Just some people confuse the concepts and often take sports nutrition for doping drugs used in the sphere of sports. "
articles.header.small.fourth=Myth \u21164. Sports supplements should be consumed every day, otherwise there will be confusing
articles.text.ten="Yes and no. There are medications that must be taken on a regular basis, otherwise a positive effect on their reception will be considerably less. For example, chondroitin and glucosamine did not give a positive effect in the irregular use. However, other additives (the same cocktails) do not require admission everyday. ''
articles.header.small.fifth=Myth \u21165. Protein shakes can harm the body
articles.text.eleven="No, protein - the basis of the power of any person. Power of modern man, as studies show, replete with fats and carbohydrates, but very poor in protein. Particularly good quality, which are easily digestible and balanced amino acids. Harm the protein virtually impossible: its excess is rapidly excreted from the body, and the lack of a negative impact on many processes in the body. "
articles.header.small.sixth=Myth \u21166. If a woman is drinking protein shakes, it will turn into a pitching
articles.text.twelve="No, the female body does not inclined to build muscle, and sports nutrition is not able to change the layout! And the fact that women take for muscle growth, actually called false hypertrophy, and due to the metabolic processes in the trained muscles. "
articles.header.small.seventh=Myth \u21167. The body quickly gets used to the sports nutrition, and it becomes ineffective

diet.text.six=This list of products is a recommendation. If you have a sweet tooth and absolutely can not imagine your life without your favorite muffins, start small. Replace them with home-made cakes with a reduced amount of oil and sugar. The same is the situation with fast food. Try to find a useful alternative!
diet.text.seven=If you have broken a diet, do not throw started and do not think about how to start the first Monday. Continue to program as if nothing had happened, slightly adjusting the fat and calorie content of these meals.

training.summary=Look
training.text.one=In this program massonabornoy perfect combination of basic and enhanced insulating exercise intense and very productive 5-minute burns approaches.

training.header.list.six=Lecture hall:
training.text.list.six=Men and women
training.header.average.one=Program description
training.header.list.seven=Training program for mass set is designed for mid-level athletes training which:
training.text.list.seven.first=We achieved the first successes and are confident that they know how to build muscle.
training.text.list.seven.second=Master the correct technique of performing the principal of compound movements.
training.text.list.seven.third=They know how to make effective diet for a set of muscle mass.
training.strong.one=Overload.
training.text.two=To build muscle overload factor is of paramount importance. The arguments of each set to the maximum number of repetitions, and complete it in the time when the equipment starts to limp, or when you know that muscle failure is waiting in the next iteration. Do not exercise to failure. The problem - forcing massonabora rather than depletion of the body and central nervous system.
training.text.three=Grow operating weight for each exercise as often as possible, but when it makes sense. I recommend using the same weight in each set individual exercises, and when you can confidently carry out the planned number of reps in all sets, increase the load.
training.strong.two=Range repetitions.
training.text.four=repetition range - just a landmark. Do not worry if at times you will go beyond the stop or to the bottom of the range. Again, the decisive factor is overloaded. repetition range - just a tool.
training.strong.three=5 minute burn.
training.text.five=For each body part provided 5 minute burn. These approaches are particularly brutal. Put the curb weight, which allows you to do about 12-15 repetitions. 5 minutes make much repetitions as you can with the weight resting as needed. Pauses should be short - breath, regained a little strength, and have continued to wind a repeat count.
training.text.six=5-minute run burns approaches not before the scheduled number of sets and repetitions. The challenge - finally wear down the already tired muscles. Do not worry (you can not even count) about the number of sets and reps. Instead, try to make the maximum possible number of repetitions, resting as much as you need to in order not to collapse from exhaustion.
training.header.big.two=Intensive program for breast
training.text.seven=To the beach or in the pool was not ashamed to undress, attack the chest muscles in all directions and use the drop-sets are combined in ultra-intense workout for the chest!

training.text.list.eighth.fifth=Dumbbells, Rod
training.text.list.eighth.sixth=Men and women
training.header.average.two=Description of training
training.text.eighth=Raise the efficiency of the chest workout to the next level! No one denies that the bench press with large tonnage - King massonabora on the territory of the chest, but adding the new variants of the force vector, hand position and technique, we can work more efficiently and achieve more impressive results.
training.text.nine=Sophisticated training plan aimed at muscle hypertrophy, will be an excellent starting point.
training.text.ten=Laying out in the gym at one hundred percent, ending the extra repetition and smashing muscles, you will get exactly the desired result! Our goal - to make the maximum result and raise the productivity of training to the next level, and for this it is necessary not only to puff under the bar, but also to think a head. Connect these techniques to bring workout chest and their results into a new orbit.
training.header.average.three=1. Start with the weights! Add a drop set
training.text.eleven=We must start with a heavy bench press on a flat bench. At the same time exercise involved shoulder and elbow joints, and this is one reason why the bench press are better suited for building mass than odnosustavnye information. You can raise a much greater tonnage.
training.text.twelve=Do not forget about the workout. A good option - some exercises for the rotator cuff, and then a couple of light approaches to the bench press. Some prefer to lift weights, and other post. If you have always started with the rod, for a change, switch to the dumbbell, and vice versa. With the dumbbells you will achieve slightly better muscle contraction, and the maximum operating weight overpower bench barbell.
training.text.thirteen=Whatever it was, polyarticular presses - ideal candidates for muscle hypertrophy and enable muscles to work. They allow us to move ultraboundary cargo across the entire range of motion, working through the target muscle to the maximum.
training.text.fourteen=In general, the ideal range of repetitions for muscle development - 8-12 repetitions, but the first approach of training (after a couple of warm-up exercises) take greater operating weight, do 6 reps and shocking muscles increased stress. Perform 3 sets of operating heavy 6-8 reps.
training.text.fifteen=In the fourth approach, do drop set; significantly reduce weight and make muscles burn, focusing on reducing and squeezing the pectoral. In the last couple of repetitions you can even take a 5-second pause on hold at the top, and to great effect lower the load as slowly as possible. It should be noted that in this type of training through fear is very useful!
training.header.average.four=2. Add up the slope
training.alt.one=Exercise the chest
training.figcaption.one=Bleed the powerful chest zhimom dumbbells on incline bench.
training.text.sixteen=It's time to target the ever-lagging upper chest, and this is best suited presses on an incline bench. Use the same pattern as in the previous exercise, but now heavy approaches of 6-8 reps closes the fifth drop set.
training.text.seventeen=One of the important points, the degree of tilt of the bench. We do not want to press in the slope became stressful for deltoids, we need a slight slope, which will load the upper chest without unnecessary overload deltas.
training.text.eighteen=Raise the drill to the next level. Perform 2 sets with a slope of about 30 degrees, another 2 with a slope of 15 degrees in the area, and then make the finishing spurt by using a drop-set, focusing on reducing and squeezing muscles. Recruit muscle fibers to complete the program and get an over-limit results!
training.header.average.five=3. Go to the slope down
training.text.nineteen=Next in line is a bench on the bench with a negative slope, another terrific exercise for the full development of breasts! If the first two exercises you do with dumbbells, check out a post move in Smith's trainer or even a simulator Hammer Strength. In some cases it is better to work in the gym, especially after a few exercises on the background of accumulated fatigue. In the gym you can fully concentrate on the bench. And they are especially good for burns sets, if you do not have a reliable spotter.
training.text.twenty=In the simulator, you can slightly change the vector of movement, adjusting itself under the seat and the position of the arms. As a rule, the maximum power we can generate with arms at chest level lower divisions. Start with the two approaches in this position, and then adjust the angle of the bench press and from a higher point in the area of the middle / lower chest department.
training.header.average.six=4. isolation exercises Time
training.text.twenty.one=One of the best exercises for isolating the breast - a mix of hands. We have the opportunity to choose from several options: You can perform the information in the simulator butterfly in cable simulator or with dumbbells. I would not say that one is better than another, it all depends on personal preference.
training.text.twenty.two=I like mixing on the block, or dumbbells because it has no restrictions on the magnitude and trajectory. You can keep your arms and shoulders in the most comfortable position throughout the range of motion. Try to do 4 sets of 8-12 reps. In them, we try to fully focus on squeezing and reducing the pectoral muscles with the help of their isolation.
training.text.twenty.three=If you use a rope simulator, you can safely change the vector of movement in this exercise. The standing or lying on the bench, do approach, bringing his hands to his chest center. Then make an approach with a small displacement vector down and another one pointing up vector. Remember to keep your hands straightened (elbows only slightly bent), make the pectoral muscles to work! Do not let fatigue spoil the performance of equipment and turn the exercise to the next mode.
training.header.average.seven=5. The Final Touches
training.alt.two=Push ups
training.figcaption.two=Push-ups are very good for dobivku at the end of the workout.
training.text.twenty.four=Most powerlifters would be satisfied and would call it a great workout chest. But our goal - to get to the next level, to boost muscle growth, to really crush the already tired muscles and make them adapt to the new realities. We want to see as a result of recovery muscle grew stronger, heavier and stronger.
training.text.twenty.five=Then came the turn of exercises, which for many years of training, we have a relationship to the point of love and hate - push-ups. Great option for the development of the chest muscles and even the best exercise to work on the verge of failure. When you have finished all heavy lifts, push-ups seem simple.
training.text.twenty.six=In the final exercise, do 3 sets to failure. (Rest 60 seconds between sets). To add variety, change the vector, moving the hands in each approach.
training.header.big.three=Basic training program for beginners
training.text.twenty.seven=Engage on this 8-week training program and you will not long remain a beginner.
training.strong.four=Author:
training.text.twenty.eighth=Bill Geiger
training.text.twenty.nine=Nothing kills the motivation faster than the lack of progress. This complex will make you a mid-level athlete in just two months. You do not have to pedal the bike for a few months without any tangible results; Our goal - to make rapid progress to get the incentive and motivation to move from one exercise to the next.
training.text.thirty=The program consists of two parts. The two-day split for beginners (you're working all the major muscle groups two days, repeating split twice a week) focused not on absolute beginners; they should get to know "the whole body workout for beginners." We proceed from the assumption that you are already familiar with the basic exercises. Did you go back to training after a long break or injury. Perhaps you have been doing the program for a beginner for some time and are now ready to take the next step. Whatever it was, you've come to the right place.
training.text.thirty.one=Let's talk about the basic principles and features of the program of transition from primary to secondary level of fitness.
training.header.average.eighth=1. Start with the organization split
training.text.thirty.two=The first four weeks, you will be engaged on a two-day split, broken up into a workout for the upper and lower body. You'll train all the major muscle masses to build a strong and proportioned body, and at the same time to avoid muscle imbalance, which occurs when one muscle you spend more time than others. This imbalance may result in injury, which will throw you far back.
training.header.average.nine=2. Equipment, machinery and equipment again
training.text.thirty.three=The first month is devoted to the study of the basic laws of motion, sharpening technology, the ability to feel the muscle working and determine a suitable operating weight for each exercise. After warm-up approaches that can never be brought to muscular failure, you will perform 3-4 business approach with the planned number of repetitions specified in the training plan.
training.text.thirty.four=Understanding the relationship between the load and the number of repetitions is of paramount importance. Although it seems obvious that the higher the weight, the less reps you can perform, for the first month you need to determine the exact weight with which you can perform 12 reps evenly, not more. If you put too light weight and can do more than 12 repetitions, add the load in the next approach.
training.text.thirty.five=You should make sure that the last repetition or two you very hard, and you're working on the brink of failure. If one or two last repetitions you start to neglect the proper technique, it is not considered. The load is too great for you.
training.header.average.ten=3. Add weight slowly
training.text.thirty.six=In the first month of growth of the power indicators is due to the adaptation of neuro-muscular connections, rather than a real increase in the volume and strength of the muscle fibers. For this reason, you should not strive for extreme weight with low reps, or even to muscular failure. But as you can only perform more than 12 reps with a certain load, increase the operating weight by 5%. Remain in the range of 10-12 repetitions during the first phase. Resist the temptation to weight load.
training.header.average.eleven=4. Adjust the volume, intensity and frequency
training.text.thirty.seven=The second month, you will be engaged on a three-day Split. Volume and intensity will increase for each part of the body, so that each muscle group you train at least - two times a week to once every 4-5 days. Under load capacity, we mean the number of exercises, sets and reps. To increase it, we add one more exercise for each muscle group; it will allow you to train the target muscles from a different angle and effectively stimulate its growth.
training.text.thirty.eighth=By intensity we understand the operating weight you use. Instead, the load with which you can do 12 reps, you'll be a little bit to improve the resistance to stay in the range of 8-10 repetitions, and occasionally 6. Relatively higher weight in combination with an increase in training volume - a great trigger for muscle growth, or hypertrophy, especially when combined with proper nutrition and rest.
training.header.average.twelve=5. Engage more muscles in polyarticular exercises
training.text.thirty.nine=For almost any part of the body a good workout on the weight and strength is built around polyarticular exercises. In general, all the exercises are divided into polyarticular and odnosustavnye. In polyarticular exercises to perform lifting of the projectile, are utilized two or more joint groups. In odnosustavnyh movements is only one group of joints.
training.text.forty=For example, during benching movements occur simultaneously in the elbow and shoulder joints, while the lifting rod in the biceps only participates elbow. Since polyarticular movements involve more muscle groups, you can lift more weight work, therefore, is the best choice for stimulating muscle growth and power metrics.
training.header.average.thirteen=6. Learn how to train to failure
training.text.forty.one=While in the first phase, we recommend to choose the weight with which you approach muscular failure, in the second phase you have to know the limits of their physical capabilities. This means that if you can perform another repetition in a set with the correct technique, forward. Continue until you can complete the repetition of their own and by all the rules.
training.text.forty.two=However, do not forget that if you can perform more reps than planned for this exercise, it is necessary to raise the load. Conversely, if you can not get to the intended number of repetitions, most likely, the load is too great, and you should reduce the curb weight.
training.text.forty.three=Fine-tune the operating weight, do not forget that your goal is muscle failure, with the exception of warm-up sets. And remember, can not be sacrificed for the sake of lifting equipment is too heavy weight.
training.header.average.fourteen=7. Most gets to failure due to reverse pyramid method
training.text.forty.four=In the second phase, the number of repetitions is constructed on the principle of inverse pyramids. This means that after the warm-up approaches in a particular exercise (do as much as you see fit, but never bring it warm-up sets to failure) you select the weight with which you can only get to the intended number of repetitions. This will be the maximum weight for this exercise because in each subsequent approach, you will do as much or more repetitions (respectively, you will use a little less weight).
training.text.forty.five=Methods of reverse pyramid - a consistent approach to weight reduction and increased reps - will allow you to work to capacity in each approach. For comparison, a conventional pyramid lighter sets are not brought to muscular failure. Again, it is important to note the relationship between the plurality of approaches to capacity and anabolism - state that supports muscle growth.
training.header.average.fifteen=8. Increase the weight as strength development
training.text.forty.six=As the forces increase congestion. Your body responds to the training stimulus, becoming bigger and stronger, but if each workout you're working with the same weight and the same number of repetitions, it will not have incentives to grow. Do not marking time, repeating the same workout week after week.
training.text.forty.seven=Check your power by performing more reps with the same weight, or increasing the load on each workout - growing incentives you need to keep progressing. It can be useful training diary in which you write down the exercises, sets and reps. Once you can do more than the planned number of repetitions, increase the curb weight.
training.header.average.sixteen=9. Learn how to perform the perfect repetition
training.text.forty.eighth=In the name of security and productivity it is very important to do the exercises on all canons of strength training. Take a deep breath and hold your breath, lifting the shell in a force and explosive style, exhale only in the final phase of the movement. Inhaling lower the projectile under control.
training.text.forty.nine=At the lowest point smoothly change direction, never having beaten use to simplify recovery. Do not use momentum or other tricks to help you lift the weight. And do not lock your joints.
training.text.fifty=Hone technique during each approach to exercise, and very soon you will carry out all the movements intuitively, without thinking about the nuances of proper technique. But if you are doing from the very beginning the exercises carelessly, you can not find the error, until you get injured.
training.header.average.seventeen=10. Rest between sets should be short
training.text.fifty.one=Between sets rest of 60-120 seconds. In bodybuilding short pause between sets. It is enough to take a breath and let the blood removed from muscle by-products formed in the course of intensive training, and you successfully recover the following approach.
training.text.fifty.two=No single universal time and rest there, because the large muscle masses (legs, back) and more intensive approaches (weight close to your odnopovtornomu maximum) usually require a longer recovery. Most of you can proceed to the next approach, after the restoration of breathing.
training.header.average.eighteen=11. Not part of a training
training.text.fifty.three=As already mentioned, the work that you are doing in the gym, is a stimulus for muscle building; Currently, recovery and growth is happening outside the room and requires good nutrition and rest. Therefore, do not repeat the training too often. Muscle protein synthesis requires nutrients, time and natural hormones that are produced primarily during sleep. Take away any of these factors, and your progress will suffer.
training.text.fifty.four=If we talk about training frequency, you do not have to load the muscle group more than once every 48 hours. As you become stronger and increase your training volume, you'll need more time to recover. This is what we have provided in the second phase. Hence rest days in the schedule of training.
training.text.fifty.five=It is very important how you organize your split. You will notice that in the three-day Split presses muscles (chest, shoulders and triceps) worked in one day, because many of them are involved in the exercises for other body parts. For example, the bench press you load not only the chest muscles, but also the delta and triceps.
training.text.fifty.six=If you build a split differently, for example, on the first day to make a breast, the second - the shoulders, and on the third - the triceps, you will not have enough time to recover.
training.header.average.nineteen=12. Change your workout to keep progressing
training.text.fifty.seven=Be ready to raise their workouts to the next level in eight weeks! As a newcomer, you will get a significant jump in power performance in a month. Also, you will find that progress has slowed down and stopped, if you are one and the same program for too long. That's why this program includes elements that support your progress: changes in training split, increasing the training volume for each part of the body and increase the intensity, which means the use of more weight in the lower range of repetitions.
training.text.fifty.eighth=It is important to understand how changes in the above variables of strength training affects the growth of mass and strength. By learning to manipulate these variables, you will be able to maintain the novelty of training and finding new tests for targeted muscle overload.
training.text.fifty.nine=Follow the 12 key principles of this article, and you will not last long newcomer.
training.header.big.four=Three assault: training triceps and biceps
training.text.sixty=Do you want to pump up the muscular arms? This training program, consisting of trisetov blow up your biceps and triceps!
training.text.sixty.one=Roger Lockridge
training.text.sixty.two=What are your plans for today's training? If the agenda of the biceps and triceps, you've come to the right place. This workout is not for the faint of heart, so that your hands better prepare for Pumping to cope with the storm.
training.text.sixty.three=Your desire to be the proud owner of really muscular arms will soon become a reality - using trisety. For newcomers to the world of iron explained that trisetah you perform three exercises in a row without rest. If done correctly, trisety - a great way to raise the intensity, time-saving and pump up the muscles in the highest possible volume of blood. Stay the course and you will leave the room with the confidence that the hard work will eventually lead to long-term results.
training.text.sixty.four=Each triset of this program includes exercise with a barbell, exercise with dumbbells and an exercise in cable simulator. Each piece of equipment load your muscles in a certain way. Stange use to take maximum weight dumbbells - to get hands to work separately, and thrust - to isolate the target muscle and force it to carry out a fixed movement.
training.text.sixty.five=All three exercises triseta try to do in one place. Thus, you reduce the time it takes to transition from one movement to the next. After completing triset biceps, rest 90 seconds, and then go to trisetu triceps. Each of these two trisetov you will perform 2-3 times.
training.text.sixty.six=On the whole exercise will take no more than 25 minutes, but to finish the last repetition, you will feel that it lasted much longer. So drink your favorite predtrenik, mash and mentally ready for a crazy Pumping that you will experience.
training.header.average.twenty=Lifting barbell biceps
training.text.sixty.seven=If you want, you can use the EZ-vulture. The main squeeze of the muscles every last drop and incorporate the work of each muscle fiber throughout the approach. It is important to gently drop the bomb on each repetition, and not just give it to fall. Lowering the bar, immediately proceed to the next repetition and generate maximum power. After completing 8 repetitions, throw a rod and lift the dumbbells.
training.header.average.twenty.one=Alternate lifting dumbbells
training.text.sixty.eighth=Perform this exercise with one hand causes you to focus on each of the biceps muscle. Unilateral training contributes to the harmonious development and does not allow one hand to become stronger than the other. Again, do not rush to the eccentric (lowering) phase of motion.
training.text.sixty.nine=On the way up all supiniruet brush to your little finger looked over his shoulder. Do not swing the dumbbell. Make your biceps to do all the work yourself.
training.header.average.twenty.two=Bending a hammer on the block (in cable simulator)
training.text.seventy=Exercises in cable simulator maintain stable voltage to the working muscles, and no one fiber is left unattended. Since the rise, do not let the elbows go sideways or forward. Shoulders should be pressed against the body. At the top, spread the ends of the rope and make a second pause before lowering the load. When the weight is at the bottom and bicep stretches, stop for a moment before the start of the next repetition.
training.text.seventy.one=Since you have already exhausted your biceps in the first two exercises are likely to have to work with an unusually low weight. However, competition in the rise of the biceps in cable simulator never carried out, so that the focus on quality repetitions rather than weight that you lift.
training.header.average.twenty.three=French bench press
training.text.seventy.two=If there is no free bench, you can always do this exercise on the floor; except for limited range of motion, almost no difference. Perform each repetition, keep the shoulders in a strictly vertical position.
training.text.seventy.three=If you raise and lower the arms, most of the work carried out shoulders, not your triceps. And if you want a bit complicate your life, lower the bar behind your head.
training.alt.three=French press
training.figcaption.three=French bench press.
training.header.average.twenty.four=Lead weights back in the slope
training.text.seventy.four=To save time, you can work with both hands at the same time, but a few extra minutes spent on a careful study of individually hand to help you in the long run. Secure the trunk, not shaken. Make a second pause at the top and the bottom point of each repetition.
training.header.average.twenty.five=French press on the block standing
training.text.seventy.five=This exercise will help you to properly stretch and cut all three heads of the triceps. Dilute the ropes when the triceps are over your head and completely reduced. On the way down do not try to stretch the muscles at all costs. Your hands have to go through this motion without pain.
training.header.average.twenty.six=Implementation of the triple assault
training.text.seventy.six=By interleaving trisetov for the biceps and triceps muscle group each received a respite, while the other works. This training format also allows you to work out every muscle with greater intensity, which should lead to an increase in strength and size hands.
training.text.seventy.seven=Beginners should focus on two rounds; This means that you must make every triset twice. If you exercise more than a year and are confident in their abilities, try to overcome the 3 laps.
training.text.seventy.eighth=I advise you to train under the scheme once a week. However, if your hands - your weak spot, and you need to raise the load to trigger new growth, use complex trisetov twice a week. In this case, divide the workout at least three days of rest.
